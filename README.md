## Configuring project

Before starting, you'll need a [Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with the following permissions:
- `bot` with the `Send Messages` and `Use Slash Command` permissions
- `applications.commands` scope

> ⚙️ Permissions can be configured by clicking on the `OAuth2` tab and using the `URL Generator`. After a URL is generated, you can install the app by pasting that URL into your browser and following the installation flow.

## Creating your Cloudflare worker

Next, you'll need to create a Cloudflare Worker.

- Visit the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
- Click on the `Workers` tab, and create a new service using the same name as your Discord bot

## Running locally

First clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/b0sc/boscbot.git
```

Then navigate to its directory and install dependencies:

```
cd boscbot
npm install
```

> ⚙️ The dependencies in this project require at least v18 of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Local configuration

> 💡 More information about generating and fetching credentials can be found [in the tutorial](https://discord.com/developers/docs/tutorials/hosting-on-cloudflare-workers#storing-secrets)

Rename `example.dev.vars` to `.dev.vars`, and make sure to set each variable.

**`.dev.vars` contains sensitive data so make sure it does not get checked into git**.

### Register commands

The following command only needs to be run once:

```
$ npm run register
```

### Run app

Now you should be ready to start your server:

```
$ npm start
```

### Setting up ngrok

When a user types a slash command, Discord will send an HTTP request to a given endpoint. During local development this can be a little challenging, so we're going to use a tool called `ngrok` to create an HTTP tunnel.

```
$ npm run ngrok
```

This is going to bounce requests off of an external endpoint, and forward them to your machine. Copy the HTTPS link provided by the tool. It should look something like `https://8098-24-22-245-250.ngrok.io`. Now head back to the Discord Developer Dashboard, and update the "Interactions Endpoint URL" for your bot:

![interactions-endpoint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/534619/157510959-6cf0327a-052a-432c-855b-c662824f15ce.png)

This is the process we'll use for local testing and development. When you've published your bot to Cloudflare, you will _want to update this field to use your Cloudflare Worker URL._

### Storing secrets

The credentials in `.dev.vars` are only applied locally. The production service needs access to credentials from your app:

```
$ wrangler secret put DISCORD_TOKEN
$ wrangler secret put DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY
$ wrangler secret put DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID
```
